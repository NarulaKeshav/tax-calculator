# Tax Calculator
This is a little side project that *italics*calculates the price after tax.*italics*

# How it Works
By assigning the HTML `code`<input>`code` id, I was able to call them through JavaScript.
Then by calling the `getElementsById()` method, I was able to capture the input.

```
<input type="text" id="price">
var price = documents.getElementById('price');
```

It may not be the best project, but it's a start! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž
