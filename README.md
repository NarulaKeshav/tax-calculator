This is a little side project that *calculates the price after tax.*

# How it Works
By assigning the HTML `<input>` id, I was able to call them through JavaScript.
Then by calling the `getElementsById()` method, I was able to capture the input.


```
<input type="text" id="price">
var price = documents.getElementById('price');
```

I wanted to use jQuery, but I'm trying to learn JavaScript so I did it the old fashioned way, although I did use jQuery for the `click(function() { ... })`

I'm learning JavaScript and building small projects like these to learn how to use JavaScript with HTML.
It may not be the best project, but it's a start! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž
